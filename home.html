<p>I call it luck. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. He is here. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I call it luck. You mean it controls your actions? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>

The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--
I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
